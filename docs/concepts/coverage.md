Test coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed while running tests. It helps identify untested parts of your code, helping you to ensure that your tests are comprehensive and edge cases are not missed.

In IDEs such as PhpStorm, you can run tests with coverage reporting enabled, which will give you a tool window showing the coverage of your files in the context of the project structure as well as highlight lines in individual files showing what is covered and what is not. Coverage reporting tools also have an option to generate HTML reports, which allow you to view coverage results in a web browser and share them with others.
