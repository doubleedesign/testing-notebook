# About

More pseudo-documentation than a blog, but less planned and complete than an e-book or a tutorial series. It's my testing notebook!

This site is initially a companion to my talk _Catching all the (edge) cases: Getting started with automated testing_ at [WordCamp Brisbane 2025](https://brisbane.wordcamp.org/2025/schedule/), but being a "notebook", it's also a place to gather my learnings and examples that build upon and expand beyond the content of the talk.

I hope this site gives you some helpful insight into how I approach automated testing, in WordPress and beyond.
