heading: Why use automated testing?
---

If you are a web developer, using automated testing as part of your workflow can help you:

:::details Increase development efficiency and accuracy
Automated testing allows you to automatically and quickly iterate through test cases and scenarios as you work, reducing the tedious busywork of manually setting up test data and re-checking all the use cases with every relevant code change. This leads to faster development and more reliable code.
:::

:::details Guard against regressions, bugs, and unintended effects of changes 
Automated tests can be run frequently to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality or introduce other unintended side effects such as UI issues. They help you efficiently catch problems before they reach manual QA, the client, or end users.

A comprehensive test suite can serve as:
 - a baseline when introducing new features, as you can confirm the current functionality and ensure new features don't break it
 - a safety net for refactoring and improving existing code, by automatically verifying that the changes do not have unintended consequences. 
:::

:::details Write plain-language dev documentation
Automated tests can serve as a form of documentation for your code, providing clear statements of requirements and examples of how different parts of the site are expected to behave. 

When using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, you can write tests before implementing features. This can help you:
- clarify and document requirements and scope 
- identify edge cases early, enabling you to deliver higher quality code with minimal additional effort
- more accurately estimate and monitor your progress.

Tests-as-documentation can be especially useful for new developers joining the project, and can be your gift to future developers who may inherit the site later down the track - including your future self!
:::

There are several different types of automated tests, each with pros and cons. Depending on the nature of your project, you may use a combination of testing types to achieve optimal coverage in the time you have.

:::tip Tip
Automated testing can also be instrumental in reducing change risk in non-client projects, such as:
- open source libraries/plugins/etc with multiple disparate contributors
- standalone products that you distribute for use in many projects (such as CMS plugins).
