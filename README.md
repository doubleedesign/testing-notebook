# Time For Testing

This repo is the source code of the [Time For Testing](https://timefortesting.net/) website, a "living book" of information, guides, and examples for automated testing for CMS-driven websites and general web front-ends.

## Suggestions and requests

I am very open to suggestions and requests. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/doubleedesign/testing-notebook/issues) are the best place to raise them. Can't make any promises as this is one of my many side projects, but please do feel free to raise an issue if you have a suggestion or example/tutorial request you think I might be able to provide.

## Contributing

Contributions via GitHub pull request are very welcome!

The site is built using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) version 2.x, so you just need Node installed and a clone of this repo to get up and running locally.

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

There isn't currently an automated pipeline to deploy changes to the live site, I do that manually via old-school SFTP.
